Simple mpide Sketch to create an animation with the SharpMem 96x96 LCD screen. Brilliant!

Use a ChipKIT uno32, and
Sharp Memory Display From EmbeddedArtists

Uses DSPI for SPI bus control.
Constructor takes two parameters: LCD_SS, DISP
  LCD_SS is the Slave Select pin for the LCD. Can be any pin other than 11,12,13
    watch out for pin 10 on Joel's board! it is acting funny
  DISP pin is the Display control pin for the LCD. Can be any pin other than 11,12,13
